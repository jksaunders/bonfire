# bonfire 🏕

`bonfire` is the design system that powers [project-camper-van](https://github.com/jksaunders/project-camper-van).

## Updating

Run [`npm version patch|minor|major`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) then push via `git push --follow-tags` 🎉. Note that this currently triggers two Travis CI builds, so make sure to go cancel one of them to keep build statistics accurate.
