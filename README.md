# bonfire 🏕

`bonfire` is the design system that powers [project-camper-van](https://github.com/jksaunders/project-camper-van), [debra-dynes](https://github.com/jksaunders/debra-dynes) and [last-minute-pickup](https://github.com/jksaunders/last-minute-pickup). Check out the [current Storybook instance](https://jksaunders.github.io/bonfire)!

Currently still very much a work in progress. I'll remove this note once it's ready to be looked at!

## Updating

Run [`npm version patch|minor|major`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) then push via `git push --follow-tags` 🎉.
