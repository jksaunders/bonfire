# bonfire 🏕

`bonfire` is the design system that powers [project-camper-van](https://github.com/jksaunders/project-camper-van). Check out the [current Storybook instance](https://jksaunders.github.io/bonfire)!

Currently still very much a work in progress. I'll remove this note once it's ready to be looked at!

Note: will not be following semantic versioning until version 1.1.0.

## Updating

Run [`npm version patch|minor|major`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) then push via `git push --follow-tags` 🎉.
